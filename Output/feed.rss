Users can manage templates that they edit in Stempel or in in any other editor of their choice. New files are created by right clicking in Finder or by adding an item to Finder’s toolbar.</p><figure><img src="https://hans.coffee/apps/Stempel/right-click.png" alt="Screenshot"/><figcaption>The right click menu in Finder showing the configured templates.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a natural behavior that users might expect as it is built into most other operating systems. There even is a <em>New Folder</em> button in the right click menu in Finder.</p><figure><img src="https://hans.coffee/apps/Stempel/main.png" alt="Screenshot"/><figcaption>A screenshot of Stempel showing multiple templates in the sidebar while editing the template for a <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> Document.</figcaption></figure><p>Templates can be managed right in the app, the sidebar shows a list of templates and they can be edited in the simple editor right in the app. However right clicking a template or using the <em>File</em> menu in the toolbar allows the user to open the file in their favorite editor like Sublime Text or Nova, or to reveal it in Finder.</p><figure><img src="https://hans.coffee/apps/Stempel/complex.png" alt="Screenshot"/><figcaption>An example of a file that cannot be edited as plain text. Clicking on it will open Numbers.</figcaption></figure><p>Stempel allows for editing of plain text files. Other files receive an inline preview and can be edited with an external app.</p><figure><img src="https://hans.coffee/apps/Stempel/folders.png" alt="Screenshot"/><figcaption>A template folder containing multiple files.</figcaption></figure><p>Even folders can be used as templates. This way complex projects like a website with <abbr><span class='real-caps'>HTML</span><span class='small-caps' hidden>html</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class='real-caps'>PHP</span><span class='small-caps' hidden>php</span></abbr> and JavaScript files can be instantiated easily from a template.</p><figure><img src="https://hans.coffee/apps/Stempel/permissions.png" alt="Screenshot"/><figcaption>The file permissions editor. This allows for new files to be marked as executable.</figcaption></figure><p>One powerful feature offered by Stempel is to configure <abbr><span class='real-caps'>POSIX</span><span class='small-caps' hidden>posix</span></abbr> permissions for files. Each file can be individually selected to be readable, executable, or writable for user, group, and world. This is especially handy when creating templates for executable files such as scripting languages like Python. Stempel allows for this configuration to occur via a graphical representation of the familiar <code>ls</code> output as a table. Presets allow for a quick configuration of text and script files.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://hans.coffee/apps/Hexer</guid><title>Hexer</title><description></description><link>https://hans.coffee/apps/Hexer</link><pubDate>Wed, 9 Aug 2023 17:44:06 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Hexer</h1><h2>Hex File Viewer</h2><p>Hexer is a desktop level hex viewer packed with features. It was developed from the ground up for iOS and iPadOS. It is natural and intuitive to use for everyone. It is integrated with the Files app. So you can browse Dropbox, Google Drive, your git repositories, your downloads, your documents in iCloud Drive or your desktop. Or you can just share any file to it.</p><figure><img src="https://hans.coffee/apps/Hexer/main.png" alt="screenshot"/><figcaption>The primary screen in Hexer showing <abbr><span class='real-caps'>ASCII</span><span class='small-caps' hidden>ascii</span></abbr> and hexadecimal representation of a file. The analysis screen provides additional information about the document and the current selection.</figcaption></figure><p>Bytes are highlighted in different colors: Printable characters are cyan, spaces blue, null bytes grey, control characters pink and so on. The colors appear across the binary, hexadecimal, and <abbr><span class='real-caps'>ASCII</span><span class='small-caps' hidden>ascii</span></abbr> column — or can just be turned off completely.</p><figure><img src="https://hans.coffee/apps/Hexer/themes-and-options.png" alt="screenshot"/><figcaption>Overview of some of the themes available in Hexer. Themes can be set to always dark or light or to adapt to the system theme automatically. The right screenshot shows some of the options that can be configured, the code pages available as well as the order and visibility of the columns.</figcaption></figure><p>Multiple options are available to aid your inspection of files. Many popular themes from text editor and terminals are available. Line numbers can be shown and overscroll enabled. When you copy or share text you have complete control over the formatting. Column counts in powers of two (8 bytes, 16, 32, ...) or in any number that fits if you so choose. The app supports <abbr><span class='real-caps'>ASCII</span><span class='small-caps' hidden>ascii</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class='real-caps'>ISO</span><span class='small-caps' hidden>iso</span></abbr> Latin 1 and <abbr><span class='real-caps'>EBCDIC</span><span class='small-caps' hidden>ebcdic</span></abbr> code pages. The <abbr><span class='real-caps'>UI</span><span class='small-caps' hidden>ui</span></abbr> is navigable by keyboard on iPad and there are shortcuts to toggle almost everything. Further features are left for you to discover.</p><figure><img src="https://hans.coffee/apps/Hexer/search.png" alt="screenshot"/><figcaption>Search sidebar in Hexer. The sidebars in the iPad app take full screen on iPhone.</figcaption></figure><p>You can search even large files in Hexer. While searching you have the option to choose the <abbr><span class='real-caps'>ASCII</span><span class='small-caps' hidden>ascii</span></abbr> or hexadecimal column in case you are looking for specific byte sequences. Results can be filtered with regular expression and case sensitivity can be enabled or disabled. A list of results is previewed and you can jump to their location in the document and skip between the m with arrow keys on iPad.</p><p>Hexer allows for detailed analysis of files or the current selection. You can decode to integers, see byte frequencies, detect file signatures – also known as magic numbers – or read metadata like creation date and <abbr><span class='real-caps'>UNIX</span><span class='small-caps' hidden>unix</span></abbr> permissions.</p><h2>The App is made by a real person out of love</h2><p>When you buy the app (no hidden in app purchases) the money goes straight to me to support development of this and other apps. If you have any questions or feature requests you can just write me an email and let me know. I will continue development with many more planned features like editing.</p><h2>The App is friendly</h2><p>There are no in app purchases, ads, tracking, nor is there any data collected. You buy it once and then use it. Nothing more. Nothing less.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
