*Hallo,*

I am German independent iOS/macOS app developer who just graduated with a *Master of Science in Satellite Technology*.

I have always had a great interests in computers, software development, and Apple platforms.
I first taught myself Python, which I since have used almost daily for university and hobby projects.
However my greatest passion lies in designing user experiences.
For this reasons I created some smaller apps as side projects during my university education and I am now getting more serious with developing them further.
