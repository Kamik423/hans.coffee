*Hallo,*

I am an independent iOS/macOS app developer from Germany and I just graduated with a *Master of Science in Satellite Technology*.

I have always had a keen interest in computers, software development, and Apple platforms. 
I first taught myself Python, which I have since used almost daily for university and hobby projects. 
However, my greatest passion lies in designing user experiences. 
For this reason, I have created some smaller apps as side projects during my university education, and I am now getting more serious about developing them further.

If you are interested check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/Kamik423) or [^cv^](https://github.com/Kamik423/cv/raw/main/cv%20Hans%20Sch√ºlein%20en.pdf).
