# Colophon

This website is generated using the free and open source Swift static site generator [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish) by John Sundell.
The entire source code is open source on a [GitHub](https://github.com/kamik423/hans.coffee) page.
It is served as pure ^html^ and ^css^, no JavaScript is used, no cookie is ever set;
this website is 100% natural;
no animals were harmed in the making of this website.

The body text is set in [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com) by Friedrich Althausen.
The headlines are set in [Space Grotesk](https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/space-grotesk) by Florian Karsten.
Monospaced text in code samples is set in [^ibm^ Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex).
All of these are published under the [^sil^ open fonts license](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL_web).

Italic small capitals have been faked for Vollkorn by using oblique small capitals of a heavier weight.

Syntax highlighting is statically baked into the ^html^ of the website â€“ no JavaScript here as well.
It uses the [Pygments](https://pygments.org) syntax highlighter which is licensed under the ^bsd^ 2-clause license.
I adapted the *xcode* color scheme from there while tweaking it and creating my own dark color scheme, both based on the colors used as syntax highlighting in [Xcode 15](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

The header icons are adapted from [icons8](https://icons8.com).
All other used images are my own work unless a specific source is given.
